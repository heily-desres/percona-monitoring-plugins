Percona Amazon RDS Monitoring Template for Cacti
================================================

This page gives installation instructions specific to the RDS graph template,
shows examples of graphs in the RDS template collection, and shows what they
do.

Installation Notes
------------------

This template utilizes the Python script and ``boto`` module (Python interface
to Amazon Web Services) to get various RDS metrics from CloudWatch.

To make the script working, please follow the instructions:

* Install the package: ``yum install python-boto`` or ``apt-get install python-boto``
* Create a config /etc/boto.cfg or ~cacti/.boto with your AWS API credentials.
  See http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig

The script ``~cacti/scripts/ss_get_rds_stats.py`` that is run under ``cacti`` user
should have permissions to read the config /etc/boto.cfg or ~cacti/.boto.

For example::

   [root@centos6 ~]# cat /etc/boto.cfg
   [Credentials]
   aws_access_key_id = THISISATESTKEY
   aws_secret_access_key = thisisatestawssecretaccesskey

If you do not use this config with other tools such as our Nagios plugin,
you can secure this file the following way::

   [root@centos6 ~]# chown cacti /etc/boto.cfg
   [root@centos6 ~]# chmod 600 /etc/boto.cfg

**IMPORTANT:** If you decide to create ``~cacti/.boto`` instead, which is not secure
as it falls under the web directory, ensure this file is not accessible from Web.
Check out :ref:`Hardening Cacti setup <hardening_cacti_setup>` guide.

Test the script assuming DB instance identifier is ``blackbox``::

   [root@centos6 ~]# sudo -u cacti ~cacti/scripts/ss_get_rds_stats.py --ident=blackbox --metric=CPUUtilization
   gh:6.53

To check RDS details you can run::

   [root@centos6 ~]# sudo -u cacti ~cacti/scripts/ss_get_rds_stats.py --ident=blackbox --print
   ...

Now, you can add a device to the Cacti using Amazon RDS Server template and graph it.

**NOTE**: you need to specify DB instance identifier as ``Hostname`` on adding device page.

By default, the region is set to ``us-east-1``. You can re-define it globally in boto config or
specify per instance on data source level in Cacti. You can also set region to ``all`` which will
have the script to find region for a given instance automatically. However, this will work much slower
than specifying region explicitly.

Also you can specify boto profile name on data source level in Cacti in case you have multiple in use.

Sample Graphs
-------------

The following sample graphs demonstrate how the data is presented.

.. image:: images/rds_binlog_disk_usage.png

The amount of disk space occupied by binary logs on the master.

.. image:: images/rds_cpu_utilization.png

The percentage of CPU utilization.

.. image:: images/rds_database_connections.png

The number of database connections in use.

.. image:: images/rds_disk_iops.png

The average number of disk I/O operations per second.

.. image:: images/rds_disk_latency.png

The average amount of time taken per disk I/O operation.

.. image:: images/rds_disk_queue_depth.png

The number of outstanding IOs (read/write requests) waiting to access the disk.

.. image:: images/rds_disk_throughput.png

The average number of bytes read from/written to disk per second.

.. image:: images/rds_memory.png

The amount of used random access memory. The total available memory is the value
according to the instance class.
See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html

.. image:: images/rds_replica_lag.png

The amount of time a Read Replica DB Instance lags behind the source DB Instance.

.. image:: images/rds_storage_space.png

The amount of used storage space.

.. image:: images/rds_swap_usage.png

The amount of swap space used on the DB Instance.
